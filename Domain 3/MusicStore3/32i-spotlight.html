                The kazoo is a rather unique instrument in that a person
                hums into it in order to get it to make noise.
            </p>
            <p>
                The kazoo is known as a membranophone instrument, which is a
                family of instruments to where a vibrating membrane makes
                the noise.

                The Kazoo originates in Africa

                Kazoos can be made out of metal, plastic,
                or even through toilet paper tubes as a do-it-yourself project.
