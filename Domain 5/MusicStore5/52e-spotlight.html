                The kazoo is a rather unique instrument in that a person
                hums into it in order to get it to make noise.

            <p>
                The kazoo is known as a membranophone instrument, which is a
                family of instruments to where a vibrating membrane makes
                the noise.

                The Kazoo originates in Africa
                and dates back hundreds of years.

                Kazoos can be made out of metal, plastic,
                or even through toilet paper tubes as a do-it-yourself project.
